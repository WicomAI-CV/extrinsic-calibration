## About the Project 
This project was part of the sensor fusion and computer fusion research project at [WiComAI Lab](https://wireless.kookmin.ac.kr/) of Kookmin University, Seoul, South Korea. 
The project aims to predicts the misalignment in the extrinsic parameters between the camera and LiDAR by leveraging [EfficientNetV2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00298) 
as feature extraction network and CSA transformer from [Lite Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10809) as feature matching network. The deep learning network is trained 
and tested using the [KITTI Odometry dataset](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php).
